i3-quickswitch
==============

Overview
--------
This utility for i3, inspired by Pentadactyl's :buffers command, allows you to
quickly switch to and locate windows on all your workspaces, using an
interactive dmenu prompt.

Here's how it looks in action:

Dependencies
------------
i3-quickswitch requires dmenu (which you likely already have installed), and
i3-py, which you can install with `pip install i3-py`.

i3-quickswitch was tested in Python 2.7.3 and 3.2.3.

Installation
------------
Nothing automatic (yet). Drop it in your ~/bin or something. Be creative.
